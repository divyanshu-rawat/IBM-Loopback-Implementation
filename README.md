### My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

StrongLoop is now IBM API Connect.

* IBM API Connect is a complete solution that addresses all aspects of the API lifecycle, for both on-premises and cloud         environments. It offers comprehensive capabilities to create, run, manage, secure and monetize APIs and microservices.         Delivering an unparalleled, integrated user experience, it enables rapid deployment and simplified administration of APIs.

* Using automated, model-driven tools in IBM API Connect, Developers can easily discover existing APIs and back-end data         sources and create new APIs and microservices based on the popular open-source Node.js Express and LoopBackÂ® frameworks -all   managed from a single unified console.

* In this application you will be introduced to Backend as a Service (BaaS), a recent phenomenon that is overtaking the way web   app and mobile app developers are approaching the server-side support. 

* This application uses BaaS as an alternative to full-fledged in-house server-side implementation.
